    Aside from groomsmen (and Summer/Kevin), you're responsible for finding
    your own accommodations. That being said, it may be useful to stay near
    us should you plan on spending time with the group. We're planning on
    staying in Shinjuku. We have not yet made any reservations, but are eyeing
    a rental near Nishi-Shinjuku Station.
  </p>
  <p>
    <b>For those staying with us</b>, Current cost is projected to be around
    $50-$60 per night, per guest.

      If you would like to stay with us, please contact me ASAP. It is possible
      we have extra beds in our rental.
